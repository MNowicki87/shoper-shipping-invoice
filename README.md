Shoper Shipping Invoice Demo
============================

![project-image](https://socialify.git.ci/MNowicki87/shoper-shipping-invoice?description=1&font=Rokkitt&logo=https%3A%2F%2Favatars.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F55910255&name=1&owner=1&pattern=Signal&theme=Light)

Application started as an educational project, soon to realize that I need it for as an internal tool to issue invoices.
It communicates with a Shoper (e-commerce SaaS) via REST API to fetch data about orders, ordered products, clients etc.
It allows to import bank statement of incoming transfers as csv and bind said payments to customer orders manually or
with a consecutive import of a csv file from payment-processing service provider (BlueMedia). Having information about
orders and payments together it can issue an invoice, which can be then be downloaded as individual PDFs or in bulk (
zipped).

At the beginning of this project I've made quite an unfortunate call and decided to use [vaadin](https://vaadin.com/),
which at the time, seemed like a perfect tool to easily build frontend. That being said I'm aware of several flaws in
the architecture, which I plan to successfully eliminate. Although, since the application is used only as an internal
tool and by me alone - I took 'working is better than perfect' approach.
